# DroneRacing-Unity

My first ever 3D unity game and my one of my most recent projects. 
It's not completely finished, as I have yet to finished the timed mode, but I wanted to add this here because it's more recent.

WASD to move, SPACE to fly up, LEFT CTRL to go down when in the actual game(not in the menu scene).
